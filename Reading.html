		<h2>WK 2 Reading Assignment</h2>
		<p>To me personally, I always view images and graphics as photos/images that are designed to be mesmerized or used for memories for families' friends and more. With all that I always took photos using my phone's camera and never gave much thought to the photos other than to share moments of my life with others. I had never taken deep thoughts about the different meanings of photography or graphic designs rather glancing at them and moving on. When I was younger i did try to get into photography but I never was able to get into the subject now regretting it as I see now how great of  away image creation is in being expressive and even going as far as to conveying your voice for others to hear or even build upon your ideas. There is a sort of story or message being conveyed through images showcasing history or knowledge. There are many things to learn from different images that range from different emotions and sides of life. However, with this opens my mind to realizing images can be used to visuals creativity or emotion better than other forms of media. As a newcomer in media creation, I am learning new ways to create and interpret media using different means such as Adobe Photoshop to create graphic or edit photos. I would use photography to capture different aspects of the world whether its everyday mundane objects to nature canvas. To explore my environment, as there are many things I don't realize are there that have meaning and purpose and to showcase these shots using my newfound skills in photo shopping and graphic design. I can relate to others being lost in the awe of media creation because there are so many aspects of the creative process that can span from different objectives or purposes. I am new in this process and want to learn more about the various aspects of the creative process to be able to represent my perspectives on different pieces of media. I can use different events that are occurring in NYC to showcase how tension is happening all over the city. But there are also naturalism and wildness in New York City in the concrete jungle. There can be many different perspectives of New York City, that can be represented through different aspects of media such as the holidays or the weather. Leaving New York City covered in snow which does not normally happen in NYC. To me, there are infinite interpretations of various images that can vary over time, ranging from different experiences of your life. I also don't strictly use images sololy about the city, instead of taking inspiration from other areas of New York City such as the parks, or even the rivers to oceans that surround NYC. There are plenty of opportunities to find and explore the depths of New York City. Using abstract ways of thinking, such as creating graphic designs based on the different infrastructure of the buildings in Manhattan or even the graffiti that can be seen EVERYWHERE to base my various ideas.  </p>
