		<p>To me personally, I always view images and graphics as photos/images that are designed to be mesmerized or used for memories for families' friends and more. With all that I always took photos using my phone's camera and never gave much thought to the photos other than to share moments of my life with others. I had never taken deep thoughts about the different meanings of photography or graphic designs rather glancing at them and moving on. When I was younger i did try to get into photography but I never was able to get into the subject now regretting it as I see now how great of  away image creation is in being expressive and even going as far as to conveying your voice for others to hear or even build upon your ideas. There is a sort of story or message being conveyed through images showcasing history or knowledge. There are many things to learn from different images that range from different emotions and sides of life. However, with this opens my mind to realizing images can be used to visuals creativity or emotion better than other forms of media. As a newcomer in media creation, I am learning new ways to create and interpret media using different means such as Adobe Photoshop to create graphic or edit photos. I would use photography to capture different aspects of the world whether its everyday mundane objects to nature canvas. To explore my environment, as there are many things I don't realize are there that have meaning and purpose and to showcase these shots using my newfound skills in photo shopping and graphic design. I can relate to others being lost in the awe of media creation because there are so many aspects of the creative process that can span from different objectives or purposes. I am new in this process and want to learn more about the various aspects of the creative process to be able to represent my perspectives on different pieces of media. I can use different events that are occurring in NYC to showcase how tension is happening all over the city. But there are also naturalism and wildness in New York City in the concrete jungle. There can be many different perspectives of New York City, that can be represented through different aspects of media such as the holidays or the weather. Leaving New York City covered in snow which does not normally happen in NYC. To me, there are infinite interpretations of various images that can vary over time, ranging from different experiences of your life. I also don't strictly use images sololy about the city, instead of taking inspiration from other areas of New York City such as the parks, or even the rivers to oceans that surround NYC. There are plenty of opportunities to find and explore the depths of New York City. Using abstract ways of thinking, such as creating graphic designs based on the different infrastructure of the buildings in Manhattan or even the graffiti that can be seen EVERYWHERE to base my various ideas.  </p>

		<h3>WK 3 Reading Assignment</h3>
		<p> AI Slop to me is completely soulless and creating irreparable damage to society as a whole.  In this week’s reading, “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster”, by Nesrine Malik, mentions how AI is creating this environment where the public cannot distinguish what’s real or AI generated in media. This alone creates so much confusion and misinformation online, on everything, ranging from political to entertainment forms of media. </p>  
			<p> Where Nesrine mentions politics using forms of AI in media, she describes it as propaganda being used everywhere, as AI really has no limitation on social media, like X as mentioned in the article. Even worse, there are many people who cannot distinguish between real life and AI generated content online. Such as the elderly who are not tech savvy, as mentioned in the article, about an elderly women using WhatsApp and being influenced over the AI generated news about Sudan. </p> 
				<p> Nesrine quotes a scholar of media and visual culture, Prof Roland Meyers, stating that AI is also fueling neofascist online creating white families and their “Ideal Worlds.” In which AI is also using the pre-existing data online showing to be bias against progressive norms such as ethnic diversity and sexual orientations. Nesrine highlights the damage that can be done with AI, creating these toxic bubbles where people are using AI for hate and most likely spreading content such as this online. Going as far as stating “White supremacy, autocracy, and fetishisation of natural hierarchies in race and gender are packaged as nostalgia for an imagined past,” to finally stating that AI can be damaging to others because, “AI is already being described as the new aesthetic of fascism.” </p> 
					<p> Social media platforms are also encouraging the use of AI Slop because of algorithms. Such as Facebook, which purely focuses on highly engaging content, practically encouraging the usage of clicks. This boosts locks creators or everyday people to have to use AI online to farm clicks or to make money cashing in on the interactions of others. </p> 
						<p> AI overall creates distractions from real life, and this is most likely why many are so interested in it while also being so accessible for anyone to use and create content with. As well as being easy to learn and to use online, there is AI everywhere online. Practically every major company has incorporated AI in some shape to their systems. As AI is cheaper than hiring a personal such as creating graphic design. This attraction worsens the situation as AI is deemed to be evolving at a rapid pace, improving itself. To me, it's somewhat unsettling how fast AI is getting better in different activities. For example, I got to know a coworker who majored in graphic designer with a bachelors and another coworker in computer science who also holds a bachelors. Both expressed how they cannot find jobs in their respective fields they studied 4 years of their life too. It’s really concerning what else AI will advance to, maybe it’ll turn out like in the movies where AI turns against humanity who knows for certain! </p>
