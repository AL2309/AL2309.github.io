 <body> <p>This showcase the emptyness almost dark parts of the stair on Hunter's Colleges Campus. I wanted to showcase how the lighting affected the enviornment using the stairs to elevate the darks from the differentiating of levels. I wanted to highlight the contrast from Hunter usually being a crowded campsu to an almost peaceful stairway.  </p>
